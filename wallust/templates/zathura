# --- Zathura Wallust Template ---

# 1. DYNAMIC RESIZING (The "Tile" Logic)
# "width" forces the document to fit the window width. 
# It works perfectly with tiling WMs like Hyprland.
set adjust-open "width"

# 2. THE TOGGLE
# Map 'i' to toggle the recolor mode (Dark/Light switch)
map i recolor

# Start with recolor OFF (standard PDF view) so you can toggle it ON with 'i'
set recolor false
set recolor-keephue true

# 3. DYNAMIC COLORS (Wallust)

# --- Recolor Mode (The "Dark Mode" used when you press 'i') ---
# This makes the "inverted" paper match your terminal background
set recolor-lightcolor "{{background}}"
set recolor-darkcolor  "{{foreground}}"

# --- Default Appearance (Standard View) ---
# Usually standard white/black for PDFs, but you can tint it if you want.
# I recommend keeping these defaults for color accuracy in standard mode.
set default-bg          "{{background}}"
set default-fg          "{{foreground}}"

# --- Status Bar ---
set statusbar-bg        "{{color0}}"
set statusbar-fg        "{{foreground}}"

# --- Input Bar ---
set inputbar-bg         "{{color0}}"
set inputbar-fg         "{{color7}}"

# --- Highlighting ---
set highlight-color        "{{color3}}"  # Warning/Yellowish
set highlight-active-color "{{color2}}"  # Success/Greenish

# --- UI Elements ---
set page-separator-color   "{{color8}}"

# --- Status Bar Formatting ---
set statusbar-show true
set statusbar-format "[%p/%P] %f"

# --- Security ---
set sandbox strict
