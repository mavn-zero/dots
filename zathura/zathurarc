# --- Zathura Wallust Template ---

# 1. DYNAMIC RESIZING (The "Tile" Logic)
# "width" forces the document to fit the window width. 
# It works perfectly with tiling WMs like Hyprland.
set adjust-open "width"

# 2. THE TOGGLE
# Map 'i' to toggle the recolor mode (Dark/Light switch)
map i recolor

# Start with recolor OFF (standard PDF view) so you can toggle it ON with 'i'
set recolor false
set recolor-keephue true

# 3. DYNAMIC COLORS (Wallust)

# --- Recolor Mode (The "Dark Mode" used when you press 'i') ---
# This makes the "inverted" paper match your terminal background
set recolor-lightcolor "#171218"
set recolor-darkcolor  "#F0F3F7"

# --- Default Appearance (Standard View) ---
# Usually standard white/black for PDFs, but you can tint it if you want.
# I recommend keeping these defaults for color accuracy in standard mode.
set default-bg          "#171218"
set default-fg          "#F0F3F7"
